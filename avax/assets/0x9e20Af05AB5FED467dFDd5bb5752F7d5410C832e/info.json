From the beginning the mission was clear; Build, nurture, and operate a sustainable passive income cryptocurrency with an inclusive and ethical community of global supporters.\n\n10 Project X tokens are required to create a single Project X node. Once a node is created, passive income generation begins. Just node up and chill, it's as easy as that. The Project X team will do the necessary research and improvements to ensure your cryptocurrency-based passive income is sustainable, trustworthy and transparent.",
