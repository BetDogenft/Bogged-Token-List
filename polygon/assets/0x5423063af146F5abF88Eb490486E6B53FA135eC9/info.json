  "description": "Candle (CNDL) is the utility and governance token for the Candle Protocol. This protocol is designed to decentralize social media and build out a community governed and moderated place to discuss and share thoughts and ideas. A comparison for how this might look like is Twitter, a centralized public social media app. In addition to this social app, they plan to add a platform for Religion and spirituality, enabling seamless access to churches and more from anywhere in the world, at anytime, and giving them a transparent and publicly audited infrastructure to operate on - at least that is their publically stated goal.Candle is backed by a network of VC's and other well-known investors, looking to kickstart a new era in communications and messaging. Coinbase is said to be the largest private backer, with speculation of a16z as well.",
